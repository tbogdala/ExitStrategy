What is this?
=============

Strat is a simple Haskell project that intends to be a turn-based strategy game, using SDL for 2d hex-tile graphics, with multi player ability and AI for single player.

Right now, strat barely does anything. It's the focus of my SDL game series on my blog where I discuss how I implemented it, from start to finish. I hope it will serve as a useful guide to practical game programming in Haskell and, secondarilly, as a decent example of code to learn from.

You can read more on my blog, starting with the first part of the series:
http://www.animal-machine.com/blog/2010/04/getting-started-with-sdl-in-haskell/

Input Commands:

Key	         -> Action
================================================================================
`		 -> Opens console
q    	      	 -> Quits program
Left/Right Arrow -> Changes selected tile
Right-Mouse    	 -> Hold down to pan window around

Console functions:

:mapsize <x> <y>
    (e.g. ":mapsize 10 10" to switch to a 10x10 map)
