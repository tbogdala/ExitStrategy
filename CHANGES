Strat version history

Version 0.0.3 (current)
=============

BROKE: probably busted cross-platform on relative art paths
BROKE: many comments are out of sync. need to review all comments in all files.

TODO: resizable window
TODO: tile setting on mouse click
TODO: console commands to load and save file


* Added a tile selection window to the lower right hand corner. The selected
  tile can be changed with the left and right arrow keys.
* Added JSON read/writing for maps (GameMap)
* Added JSON configurable Tile Sets.
* Tile Sets have different resolution sets and mouse wheel motion
  now zooms in and out.
* Merged UIState and UIConsole into UITypes to avoid cyclic module refs
  that I have no idea how to fix without weird tactics (hs-boot).
  UIConsole contains the functions related to the console.
* Implemented UIConsole basics. Displays and accepts text.
  Functions implemented:
     :mapsize x y
* Added Bitstream Vera monospace font - license included.
* Cleaned up the eventLoop function.


Version 0.0.2 
=============

* Added README
* Git repository created.
* Changed art file locations.
* Changed TerrainType order and prefix on the enum.
* Added mapCoordinates to use as keys into the TerrainMap.
* Changed eventLoop to process all events until none are
  available, only then call redrawScreen and waitEvent.
  Considerable speed up.
* loadArt now calls SDL.displayFormatAlpha on loaded pngs.
* SurfaceFlags now passed to main's setVideoMode.
