Exit Strategy version history

(HEAD)
=====

* FIXME: netbook's immediate maximise doesn't trigger a video resize.
* TODO: mulitplayerSelectLayout needs a back button. PLAYER 1-8 buttons for multi




* Added units to the tile set.
* Implemented UI Actions and basics of a game state. UILayouts also
  have their own input handler callbacks.
* UI can figure out which widgets got hit by mouse-click
* Implemented a basic user interface 'library' of sorts.
* Better error checking when loading files. The program will still bail out 
  if it cannot load the art resource it wants, but at least it does it on
  purpose now.
* Basic event loop and handling.
* Implemented UserInterfaceState (different from UIState in the editor for now!)
  uses the StateT monad.
* Implemented UserSettings - JSON configuration file.
* Started new exitstrategy executable for the game itself.


Version 0.0.3
=============

* Project now has an actual name.
* Changed back to System.Directory. pathtype is broken in Windows.* 
  Now using System.FilePath/System.Directory cross-platform system paths.
* Maps will be saved in your user app directory by default -- on UNIX
  systems this will be $HOME/.ExitStrategy/maps. On Windows, something like:
  C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\ExitStrategy
* Added version numbers to the JSON files.
* UIConsole now resizes with video resolution.
* Added ability to resize window to change video resolution.
* Clicking the left mouse button sets the tile at the location to the 
  tile shown in the selection box at the lower right column.
* Added a tile selection window to the lower right hand corner. The selected
  tile can be changed with the left and right arrow keys.
* Added JSON read/writing for maps (GameMap)
* Added JSON configurable Tile Sets.
* Tile Sets have different resolution sets and mouse wheel motion
  now zooms in and out.
* Merged UIState and UIConsole into UITypes to avoid cyclic module refs
  that I have no idea how to fix without weird tactics (hs-boot).
  UIConsole contains the functions related to the console.
* Implemented UIConsole basics. Displays and accepts text.
  Functions implemented:
     :mapsize x y
     :randomize x y
     :savemap fn
     :loadmap fn
* Added Bitstream Vera monospace font - license included.
* Cleaned up the eventLoop function.


Version 0.0.2 
=============

* Added README
* Git repository created.
* Changed art file locations.
* Changed TerrainType order and prefix on the enum.
* Added mapCoordinates to use as keys into the TerrainMap.
* Changed eventLoop to process all events until none are
  available, only then call redrawScreen and waitEvent.
  Considerable speed up.
* loadArt now calls SDL.displayFormatAlpha on loaded pngs.
* SurfaceFlags now passed to main's setVideoMode.
